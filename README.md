# ImageProcessingGUI

The official GUI software that I built for the nanoplasmonics laboratory at IIT Gandhinagar to study the blinking dynamics of quantum dot semiconductors.
The interface can be used to -
1. Plot the time trace obtained from the blinking studies.
2. Plot the dwell time data in the form of histogram.
3. Analyzed the blinking statistics using the power law exponent of its probability distribution function.
4. Fit the PDF curve using an external equation.

A tutorial for using the application is also attached with this repository.
